## Why Food Bank Procurement?

### Problem Statement

Food banks face a unique and challenging procurement landscape:

1. **Volatile Commodity Prices**: Food prices can fluctuate 15-40% seasonally
2. **Limited Budgets**: 63% of US food banks report insufficient funding for optimal food purchasing
3. **Waste**: Poor timing leads to 12-18% food waste due to spoilage
4. **Manual Processes**: 78% of small-to-medium food banks use spreadsheets for procurement decisions
5. **Information Asymmetry**: Lack access to professional forecasting tools available to commercial buyers

### Market Pain Points

**Current State:**
- Procurement managers make "gut feel" decisions based on limited data
- Miss optimal buying windows due to lack of predictive intelligence
- Cannot justify purchase decisions to boards with data
- Reactive rather than proactive procurement strategies
- Limited ability to plan around grant funding cycles

**Impact:**
- **$40,000-120,000** in annual missed savings per organization (medium-sized food bank)
- **15-20%** higher food costs compared to optimal timing
- **Increased waste** from buying products near spoilage period
